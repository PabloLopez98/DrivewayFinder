Summary: 'Driveway' allows drivers to request parking at homeowners driveways for a fee.

About the code(so far):
- Firebase is used to store all of the users data, enable push notifications, and login authentication.
- There are two main packages: app -> src -> main -> java -> pablo -> myexample:
'drivewayfinder' = driveway owner side code ; 
'drivewayfindertwo' = driver side code
